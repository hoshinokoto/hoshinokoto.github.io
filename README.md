# HTML5 Game "The Adventure"
First Time Building Phaser 3 Game

Considering my brother loves to play Nintendo video game, I decided to build a small web game as a birthday gift for him.
I learned about how to build Phaser 3 game from CodeCademy about 2 weeks ago (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-phaser).
The course wasn't too difficult for me, so I thought it should be easy to build up a mini game as a gift.
Yet, it occurs that building a game is NOT EASY at all!!
Especially because I came up with more and more ideas to add into my game along the way...
Well, after numerous searching, learning, coding and debugging for the whole week, I finally am satisfied with what I created!!
If you happen to have played my game, I appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy it!! :))
